# Land-Subsidence-monitoring
Land Subsidence monitoring
Name: Ayush Tiwari | Roll no. 21MI31010 | Documentation of 'Land Subsidence Monitoring of Mines' project for CDC verification

Objective:

The primary objective of this project was to design and develop a web application capable of:

Displaying an interactive location map of a specified area.

Extracting elevation data for the surface from open source DEM repositories.

Computing statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) for the subsidence rate of the selected location.

Presenting results in a clear and user-friendly format for monitoring land subsidence hazards.

Process:

Front-End Development

Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface.

Integrated an interactive map API (Google Maps API) to display location maps.

Data Extraction and Processing

Connected the application to open source DEMs to fetch elevation datasets of the region. Parsed and structured the raw elevation data for computation.

Back-End Logic and Computation

Implemented algorithms in JavaScript (with Python integration) to compute: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation

Visualization

Variability in subsidence rate over time is shown to the user.

Displayed elevation and subsidence results directly on the web interface.

Outcome:

Functional Web Application capable of displaying a location map and extracting all time elevation data from open source DEMs.

Automated computation of subsidence-related statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).

User-friendly dashboard presenting both numerical data and visual maps for clear interpretation.

Demonstrated integration of domain expertise (mining knowledge) with web development skills.
